    "### INTRODUCTION:\n",
    "The research paper titled \"XBNet: An Extremely Boosted Neural Network\" introduces a novel approach to addressing the challenge of effectively processing tabular data, an area where traditional neural networks often fall short. In response to the growing demand for data-driven decision-making across industries, the paper proposes the XBNet architecture, which combines the strengths of gradient boosted trees and feed-forward neural networks. By leveraging the interpretability of tree-based models and the expressive power of neural networks, XBNet aims to offer a robust solution for extracting complex patterns from structured data while maintaining transparency in model decisions. The paper introduces an optimization technique called Boosted Gradient Descent for Tabular Data, which enhances the training process by incorporating feature importance from gradient boosted trees into the weight updates of neural network layers. Through this innovative approach, XBNet seeks to significantly improve performance on tabular data tasks, offering a promising avenue for advancing data science applications in various domains.\n",

    "#### AIM :\n",
    "The aim of this project is to implement and evaluate the XBNet architecture proposed in the research paper \"XBNet: An Extremely Boosted Neural Network\" by Tushar Sarkar. The project seeks to address the limitations of traditional neural networks in handling tabular data by combining the strengths of tree-based models and neural networks.\n",

    "#### DESCRIPTION OF PAPER:\n",
    "The paper \"XBNet: An Extremely Boosted Neural Network\" proposes a novel architecture, XBNet, which combines gradient boosted trees with feed-forward neural networks for improved performance on tabular data. The architecture utilizes an optimization technique called Boosted Gradient Descent for Tabular Data to train the model effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### PROBLEM STATEMENT :\n",
    "The problem addressed in this project is the suboptimal performance of traditional neural networks on tabular data. While neural networks excel with unstructured data, such as images and text, they often underperform on tabular data compared to tree-based models. The project aims to develop a solution that can effectively leverage the strengths of both neural networks and tree-based models to achieve better performance on tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM:\n",
    "The context of the problem lies in the increasing demand for data-driven decision-making across various industries. While neural networks have shown remarkable success with unstructured data, tabular data remains a challenge due to its structured nature. Decision trees and ensemble techniques like XGBoost have been commonly used for tabular data, but they lack the expressive power of neural networks. Thus, there is a need for a hybrid architecture that can effectively handle tabular data while benefiting from the interpretability of tree-based models and the expressive power of neural networks.\n",
    "*\n",
    "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "#### SOLUTION:\n",
    "The proposed solution is the XBNet architecture, which combines gradient boosted trees with feed-forward neural networks. This hybrid architecture allows for the extraction of complex patterns from tabular data while maintaining interpretability. The Boosted Gradient Descent for Tabular Data optimization technique enhances the training process by incorporating feature importance from gradient boosted trees into the weight updates of the neural network layers. By combining the strengths of both tree-based models and neural networks, XBNet aims to achieve superior performance on tabular data tasks.\n",
